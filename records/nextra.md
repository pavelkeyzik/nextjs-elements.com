Nextra is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based static site generator.

It supports Markdown and React components ([MDX](https://nextra.vercel.app/features/mdx)), automatically generated [sidebar and anchor links](https://nextra.vercel.app/get-started#sidebar-and-anchor-links), file-system based routing, built-in syntax highlighting, image optimization, custom layouts, i18n, and all the features you love about Next.js.
